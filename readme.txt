= How do I get the Pricing Table to show? =

Here are just two steps as a guide, which should be of assistance:
* In your Dashboard, under Pricing Table you can add the tiers.
* Edit the page you would like to add the Pricing Table to, right above the content area there is a "Add Pricing Table" button, which will generate a shortcode based on the settings you choose.

You can add custom CSS through your theme, or child theme and it should overwrite the default styling of the table layout.
